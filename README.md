# Opetushallinnon tutkintoon ilmoittautuminen

A system for registering to an examination session and keeping records of student results and payments. 

## Developing

### Setup

When you first clone this repository, run:

```sh
lein setup
```

This will create files for local configuration, and prep your system
for the project.

Running the application will require a PostgreSQL DB instance with a database named oti to be up and running, and
working connections to OPH services (translations, LDAP, CAS etc.), so a VPN configuration and valid credentials are 
required.

Also, for vetuma payment to go through, return address must be HTTPS protocol. Self-signed certificates are enough, for example when used with a simple nodejs proxy.

### Configuration

The application uses [Duct framework](https://github.com/duct-framework/duct) which is based on
[Component framework](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component). This means, that the application configuration and
component dependencies are managed in external edn files.

The main configuration file is /resources/oti/system.edn. This contains configuration shared by all environments.
This configuration is augmented (and overwritten) by environment specific config files. For local development
environment these include /dev/resources/dev.edn and /dev/resources/local.edn (which is ignored by git).

Server configuration is created during deploy by filling the variables in the Ansible template 
/oph-configuration/config.edn.template.

URLs for accessing other OPH services are stored in /resources/oti/oti_url.properties.

### Localisation

The registration / participant app supports Finnish and Swedish. The translated strings are fetched from OPH
localisation service on application start-up. Doing a GET request to /oti/api/participant/translations/refresh
will reload the translations from the service.

The category for the strings is "oti".

### Email templates

The application sends HTML emails through OPH messaging service. The emails are constructed from templates located in
/resources/oti/email-templates. Localised email subjects are in a Clojure map in the file email-subjects.edn. This file
must contain a valid data structure in the following format:

    {:some-email-template-id {:fi "Subject in Finnish"
                              :sv "Subject in Swedish"}
     :another-template-id    {:fi "Subject in Finnish"
                              :sv "Subject in Swedish"}}

Base template used for all emails is in the file email-base.html. Template specific HTML markup is in files named after
the template id and language, e.g. some-email-template-id.fi.html. Email construction is handled in the namespace 
oti.service.email-templates.

The messaging service will strip any `<style>` elements and links to external stylesheets (which aren't supported by
all email services anyway), so styling has to be done inline in element attributes. 

### Environment

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
lein repl
```

Then load the development environment.

```clojure
user=> (dev)
:loaded
```

Run `go` to initiate and start the system.

```clojure
dev=> (go)
:started
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server.

```clojure
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:resumed
```

Compile front-end code and watch for changes with figwheel:

    lein figwheel

### Testing

Testing is fastest through the REPL, as you avoid environment startup
time.

```clojure
dev=> (test)
...
```

But you can also run tests through Leiningen.

```sh
lein test
```

### Migrations

Migrations are handled by [ragtime][]. Migration files are stored in
the `resources/migrations` directory, and are applied in alphanumeric
order.

To update the database to the latest migration, open the REPL and run:

```clojure
dev=> (migrate)
Applying 20150815144312-create-users
Applying 20150815145033-create-posts
```

To rollback the last migration, run:

```clojure
dev=> (rollback)
Rolling back 20150815145033-create-posts
```

Note that the system needs to be setup with `(init)` or `(go)` before
migrations can be applied.

### Generators

This project has several generator functions to help you create files.

To create a new endpoint:

```clojure
dev=> (gen/endpoint "bar")
Creating file src/foo/endpoint/bar.clj
Creating file test/foo/endpoint/bar_test.clj
Creating directory resources/foo/endpoint/bar
nil
```

To create a new component:

```clojure
dev=> (gen/component "baz")
Creating file src/foo/component/baz.clj
Creating file test/foo/component/baz_test.clj
nil
```

To create a new boundary:

```clojure
dev=> (gen/boundary "quz" foo.component.baz.Baz)
Creating file src/foo/boundary/quz.clj
Creating file test/foo/boundary/quz_test.clj
nil
```

To create a new SQL migration:

```clojure
dev=> (gen/sql-migration "create-users")
Creating file resources/foo/migrations/20160519143643-create-users.up.sql
Creating file resources/foo/migrations/20160519143643-create-users.down.sql
nil
```

## Deploying

Commits pushed to master and develop branches will cause a build to happen in 
[Bamboo](https://bamboo.oph.ware.fi/browse/OTI-OB). A successful build can be deployed to the different environments
via the Bamboo GUI.

### Health check

OTI provides two URLs for checking the application status. The path /oti/version will show the build number
and the git commit revision of the running application. The path /oti/health will check that the database connection
is working, and if so, respond with OK.

## Useful local configurations for development

local.edn (working configuration - replace placeholders with correct values for your environment):

```clojure
{:config {:db {:uri "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/oti"
               :username "${db-username}"
               :password "${db-password}"
          :ldap {:server ${ldap-host}
                 :port ${ldap-port}
                 :userdn "${ldap-userdn}"
                 :password "${ldap-password}"
                 :ssl false}
          :authentication {:oti-login-success-uri "http://localhost:3000/oti/auth/cas"}
          :cas {:user {:username "${cas-username}" :password "${cas-password}"}}
          :vetuma-payment {:oti-vetuma-uri "https://oti.local/oti/vetuma"}}}
```

node.js proxy for vetuma (needs a self-signed certificate in same dir):

```js
var fs = require('fs');
var httpProxy = require('http-proxy');
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(301, { "Location": "https://" + req.headers['host'] + req.url });
    res.end();
}).listen(80);

httpProxy.createServer({
    ssl: {
        key: fs.readFileSync('key.pem', 'utf8'),
        cert: fs.readFileSync('cert.pem', 'utf8')
    },
    target: {
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 3000
    }
}).listen(443);
```

oti.local (used above) defined in /etc/hosts:
```
127.0.0.1       oti.local
```

local.clj (start/stop figwheel in it's own JVM for hot reload):

```clojure
(ns local
  (:require [figwheel-sidecar.repl-api :as ra]))

(defn start-fw []
  (ra/start-figwheel! "dev"))

(defn stop-fw []
  (ra/stop-figwheel!))
```

Start figwheel in REPL:
```
(local/start-fw)
```
